# AI Journal Companion - Project Submission

Dear Project Teacher,

I am pleased to submit my AI Journal Companion project for your review. This application is a digital journaling tool that leverages artificial intelligence to provide personalized journal prompts, emotional analysis, and insights based on user entries.

## Project Overview

The AI Journal Companion is a web application built with Flask and the Google Gemini API. It features:

- **AI-Powered Journal Prompts**: Generates personalized prompts based on the user's current mood
- **Emotional Analysis**: Analyzes journal entries to identify emotional patterns and provide insights
- **Voice Assistant**: Includes speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities
- **Personalized Experience**: Recognizes the user's name and adapts the UI based on their mood

## Technical Implementation

The project demonstrates my skills in:
- Full-stack web development (Python/Flask, HTML/CSS, JavaScript)
- Integration with AI APIs (Google Gemini)
- Voice recognition and text-to-speech implementation
- Responsive UI design with modern CSS
- Deployment configuration for cloud hosting

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
- `app.py`: Main Flask application
- `static/`: CSS, JavaScript, and other static assets
- `templates/`: HTML templates
- `migrations/`: Database migration files
- Configuration files for deployment

## Documentation

I've included comprehensive documentation in the `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` file, which covers:
- Project overview and features
- Setup instructions
- Deployment guide
- Usage instructions
- Troubleshooting tips

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:
1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Create a `.env` file with your Gemini API key (see `.env.example`)
3. Run the application: `python app.py`
4. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## Future Enhancements

Some potential future enhancements include:
- User authentication and data persistence
- More advanced emotional analysis
- Mobile app version
- Integration with other AI models

Thank you for taking the time to review my project. I look forward to your feedback.
